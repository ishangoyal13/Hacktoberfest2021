Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

```txt
You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

    record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
    get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.
