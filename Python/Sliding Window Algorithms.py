Window Sliding Technique

The technique can be best understood with the window pane in bus, consider a window of length n and the pane which is fixed in it of length k. Consider, initially the pane is at extreme left i.e., at 0 units from the left. Now, co-relate the window with array arr[] of size n and pane with current_sum of size k elements. Now, if we apply force on the window such that it moves a unit distance ahead. The pane will cover next k consecutive elements. 
Consider an array arr[] = {5, 2, -1, 0, 3} and value of k = 3 and n = 5
Applying sliding window technique : 

We compute the sum of first k elements out of n terms using a linear loop and store the sum in variable window_sum.
Then we will graze linearly over the array till it reaches the end and simultaneously keep track of maximum sum.
To get the current sum of block of k elements just subtract the first element from the previous block and add the last element of the current block .
